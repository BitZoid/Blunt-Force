	worked in library from 1:00 - 4:45
	Listening: C418 on soundcloud
	Focus - meh, got distracted by forum posts.  having fun, though
		Mostly code organization and refactoring, cleaning up and trying to understand old code
		Created Overseer object - holds globals and acts as the input focus.  Need to think about the logistics a little more
		Created conventions, diary, and roadmap text document
			Added some conventions - need to go through and enforce them
			Moved a lot of variables to globals declared in overseer
		Did some editing on the forum post, need to resume updating as I work on this more.
	------
	move all 'child' code to the hero script? (from weapon.sript to hero.script) aside from sprite/animation stuff?
		would make it easier to handle/edit, more difficult to create new weapons? maybe
	--
	Lost changes that need to be re-added:
		Need to fix weapon rotation stuff and reorganize all that code to be more understandable
		Bullet reflection masking and related code
		Subtle lerp-ing of camera and weapon, to make it seem more fluid
		GUI
		Attack Tweaking
	------
	bugs:
		Unintentional delay on weapon positioning - would be fixed if related code moved to hero.script from weapon.script
	------
	Gotta make sure to make a backup when syncing - dont want to lose everything... for the third time...

	That's it.  Now I need to finish graduation thank-you's
	Want to get to v.0.2 by monday

	Working in library/at home intermittently
	listening: Kodaline
		All object position updating should happen at the end of the update function, 
		and if necessary should be followed by an update to the corresponding global
	Keeping positioning code where it is, unintentional lerp-effect fixed by ^^^
